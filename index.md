### CPSC 120

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, was one of my favorite labs because blackjack is one of my favorite card games to play. It is very popular around casinos and writing code to make blackjack work with C++ is fascinating. In this lab I learned how to write functions and if statements to make something like Ace cards to work.

* Lab 5

    Lab 5, was one of my favorite labs because I found it cool writing code to program a unit calculator to use different metrics systems. In this lab I learned how to use “double” properly for numbers with decimals as well as learning “static_cast<double>.”

* Lab 1

    Lab 1, was one of my favorite labs because this is when starting to code actually and slowly learned how to use GitHub and VSCode. The lab was simple and easy to figure out what to do from what we learned at the time with the lectures.
